# ParallelConvolution
This program provides a parallel implementation for 2D convolution on Grey scale images of arbitrary size using CUDA C. Input from user should specify input and output images names as well as an operation name. The program supports 8 main operations: blur, emboss, outline, sharpen, and sobel (left, right, top, and bottom). CImg C library is used to open and save images.
